As this is a class project, I did not write the header files nor proj3.cpp because they were provided as starter code. 
I still needed to provide them here, though, because they're necessary to give context to the other files of code that I did write and for the program to run properly.
All the other .cpp files I did write on my own. 
However, I do understand the header files and the main cpp file, so I'd be able to write them on my own if need be.
